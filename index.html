        <h4>CNC Laser Cutting</h4>
        <p>
          At Goodwill Industries, we provide world-class CNC Laser Cutting
          Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equipped with latest laser machines, we apply intense heat of the
          laser that literally vaporizes or melts the material in the beamâ€™s
          path. Having exceptionally fine focal point, this beam is controllable
          in nature. This permits very tight tolerance control, and concentrates
          the heat to a smaller area, or heat affected zone (HAZ) and as a
          result, there is the least part distortion of any other heat related
          cutting technology. Through our CNC Laser Cutting Service, we have a
          fine focal point and assure a very narrow kerf in even the hardest
          materials facilitating accurate dimensional control.
